# Keylogger
POP Project for Professional Skills 1

This project is for educational purposes only.
I do not intend to use this in any way, shape or form.
It's mainly to study how keyloggers work, to practice the Python programming language and to get a better understanding for how these types of programs are created.

In this project I created a basic keylogger by using Python in Visual Studio Code.

Some of the functionalities it has are:

- Capturing keystrokes
- Clipboard copying
- Getting basic system information + IP Addresses.
